# Instruments

The following instruments are supported by the TROPESS project currently.  

## AIRS

The Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) instrument was launched into Earth orbit on May 4, 2002 aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. 

The AIRS instrument is a hyper-spectral infrared atmospheric sounder. It measures a large number of wavelengths, over a two-dimensional field of view, in the infrared wavelengths.

For more information see [Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS)](https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/airs-project-instrument-suite/airs/).

## CrIS (Suomi NPP)

The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument measures the infrared spectrum emitted from the top of the atmosphere. 

CrIS is one of the instruments currently flying on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite.

## CrIS (JPSS-1 / NOAA-20)

The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument currently flying on the NOAA-20 / JPSS-1 satellite. 

The [Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/current-satellite-missions/currently-flying/joint-polar-satellite-system) includes five satellites: NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, NOAA-20, previously known as JPSS-1, NOAA-21, previously known as JPSS-2, and the upcoming JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 satellites.

## OMI

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) flies on the NASA's Aura satellite, launched into Earth orbit on July 15, 2004.

The OMI instrument is a nadir viewing imaging spectrograph that measures the solar radiation backscattered by the Earth's atmosphere and surface over the entire wavelength range from 270 to 500 nm with a spectral resolution of about 0.5 nm.
