# Welcome to TROPESS Notes

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/650417988.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/650417988)

The TROPESS Notes project provides user-friendly guides containing reproducible methods for analyzing [TROPESS Level-2](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/mission-project?title=TROPESS) atmospheric data products derived from multiple satellite missions. 

These notebooks are designed to enable scientists, regardless of 
their technical background, to access, process, and analyze data on key atmospheric constituents such as ozone, methane, and carbon monoxide.
