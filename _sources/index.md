TROPESS Notes is a Jupyter book that shows how one might go about using various TROPESS data products. It describes a few of the data use cases, as well as provides some sample code that can be used as a starter for data exploration. It does not go in-depth into any particular topic.

See the [TROPESS](https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/tropess/) web site for more details about the project.
