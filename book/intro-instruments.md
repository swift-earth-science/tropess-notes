# Instruments

The following instruments are supported by the TROPESS project currently.  

## AIRS

The Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) instrument was launched into Earth orbit on May 4, 2002 aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. 

The AIRS instrument is a hyper-spectral infrared atmospheric sounder. It measures a large number of wavelengths, over a two-dimensional field of view, in the infrared wavelengths.

## OMI

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) flies on the NASA's Aura satellite, launched into Earth orbit on July 15, 2004.

The OMI instrument is a nadir viewing imaging spectrograph that measures the solar radiation backscattered by the Earth's atmosphere and surface over the entire wavelength range from 270 to 500 nm with a spectral resolution of about 0.5 nm.
